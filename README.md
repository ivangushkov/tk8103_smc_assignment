# TK8103 Sliding Mode Controll Assignment Code

A simple repo for the code handout in the smc assignment in TK8103. Features terrible animation code and monkey forward euler simulation. Don't hate playa it works!

## How-to

Run the code by running run.py

Implement the controllers in controllers.py

To switch on actuator dynamics set dynamical_system.controller_dynamics to True

In the simulation loop change what method is being called to get u to choose switching control or continious approximation

You don't have to change anything else :)

Have fun with it (:
